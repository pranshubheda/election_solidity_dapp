# election_solidity_dapp

This was my first attempt at creating a Decentraclised Application (DAPP) after I attended an online webinar by blockgeeks which laid emphasis on the future of blockchain technologies and its applications in terms of Smart Contracts.

I had built an Etherium Smart Contract using Solidity and the Remix IDE, and used Web3.js and Angular 1 to provide a UI to the smart contract.

This Smart Contract can be used to take a poll by registering candidates for a particular election, and authorizing only certain addresses to vote. On concluding the election the votes of all the candidates are displayed.

Used Web3.js to interact with the smart contract and Etheriumjs-testrpc for local testing.

Used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcTPjpPvas8"> this</a> link as reference to provide a UI using JavaScript and Angular to the Smart Contract.
